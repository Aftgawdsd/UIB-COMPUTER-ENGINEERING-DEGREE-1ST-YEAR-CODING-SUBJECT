# UIB-COMPUTER-ENGINEERING-DEGREE-1ST-YEAR-CODING-SUBJECT
In this repository I've saved all of the projects I have done throughout my first year of coding in the UIB.
All the coding is done in JAVA using NetBeans IDE.
(26/04/2024) It's still ongoing, I'll be writing notes if any program were to become any problem.
