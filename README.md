# UIB-COMPUTER-ENGINEERING-DEGREE-1ST-YEAR-CODING-SUBJECT
In this repository I've saved all of the projects I have done throughout my first year of coding in the UIB.
Have in mind that all these programas are mere exercises, they serve no real purpose.
All the coding is done in JAVA using NetBeans IDE.
(26/04/2024) It's still ongoing, I'll be writing notes if any program were to become any problem.
